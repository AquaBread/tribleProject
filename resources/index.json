The text is an outgrowth of the new physics major curriculum developed by the Paradigms in \nPhysics program at Oregon State University. This new curriculum distributes material from the sub-\ndisciplines throughout the two upper-division years and provides students with a more gradual tran-\nsition between introductory and advanced levels. We have also incorporated and developed modern \npedagogical strategies to help improve student learning. This text covers the quantum mechanical \naspects of our curriculum in a way that can also be used in traditional curricula, but that still pre-\nserves the advantages of the Paradigms approach to the ordering of materials and the use of student \nengagement activities.\nPARADIGMS PROGRAM\nThe Paradigms project began in 1997, when the Department of Physics at Oregon State University \nbegan an extensive revision of the upper-division physics major. In an effort to encourage students \nto draw connections between the subdisciplines of physics, the structure of the Paradigms has been \ncrafted to mimic the organization of expert physics knowledge. Students are presented with a model \nof how physicists organize their understanding of physical phenomena and problem solving. Each \nof the nine short junior-year Paradigms courses focuses on a speci\ufb01c paradigm or class of physics \nproblems that serves as the centerpiece of the course and on which different tools and skills are built. \nIn the senior year, students resume a more traditional curriculum, taking six capstone courses in \nthe traditional disciplines. This curriculum incorporates a diverse set of student activities that allow \nstudents to stay actively engaged in the classroom and to work together in constructing their under-\nstanding of physics. Computer resources are used frequently to help students visualize the systems \nthey are studying.\nCONTENT AND APPROACH\nQuantum mechanics is integrated into four of the junior-year Paradigms courses and one senior-year \ncapstone course at Oregon State University. This text includes all the quantum mechanics topics \ncovered in those \ufb01ve courses. We adopt a \u201cspins-\ufb01rst\u201d approach by introducing quantum mechanics \nthrough the analysis of sequential Stern-Gerlach spin measurements. This approach is based upon \nprevious presentations of spin systems by Feynman, Leighton, and Sands; Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, \nand Laloe; Sakurai; and Townsend. The aim of the spins-\ufb01rst approach is twofold: (1) To imme-\ndiately immerse students in the inherently quantum mechanical aspects of physics by focusing on \nsimple measurements that have no classical explanation, and (2) To give students early and extensive \nexperience with the mechanics of quantum mechanics in the forms of Dirac and matrix notation. \n"

            "Sentence": "xvi \nPreface \nThe  \nsimplicity of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems allows the students to focus on these new features, \nwhich run counter to classical mechanics.\nThe \ufb01rst three chapters of this text deal exclusively with spin systems and extensions to general \ntwo- and three-state quantum mechanical systems. The basic postulates of quantum mechanics are \nillustrated through their manifestation in the Stern-Gerlach experiments. After these three chapters, \nstudents have the tools to tackle any quantum mechanical problem presented in Dirac or matrix \nnotation. After a brief interlude into quantum spookiness (the EPR Paradox and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat) \nin Chapter 4, we tackle the traditional wave function aspects of quantum mechanics. We present \nseveral quantum systems\u2014a particle in a box, on a ring, on a sphere, the hydrogen atom, and the \nharmonic oscillator\u2014and emphasize their common features and their connections to the basic pos-\ntulates. The differential equations of angular momentum and the hydrogen atom radial problem are \nsolved in detail to expose students to the rigor of series solutions, though we stress that these are \nagain eigenvalue equations, no different in principle from the spin eigenvalue equations. Whenever \npossible, we continue the use of Dirac notation and matrix notation learned in the spin chapters, \nemphasizing the importance of \ufb02uency in multiple representations. We build upon the spins-\ufb01rst \napproach by using the spin-1/2 example to introduce perturbation theory, the addition of angular \nmomentum, and identical particles.\nUSAGE\nAt Oregon State University, the content of this text is taught in \ufb01ve courses as shown below.\nJunior-Year Paradigms Courses\nSpin and Quantum \nMeasurement\nWaves\nCentral Forces\nPeriod Systems\n1."

As the wind and rain lashed at the window, he feared having to retreat to the storm cellar \nonce again. The residents of Erwin\u2019s apartment building sought shelter whenever there were threats of \ntornadoes in the area. While it was safe down there, Erwin feared the ridicule he would face once again \nfrom the other school boys. In the rush to the cellar, Erwin seemed to always end up with a random \npair of socks, and the other boys teased him about it mercilessly.\nNot that Erwin hadn\u2019t tried hard to solve this problem. He had a very simple collection of \nsocks\u2014black or white, for either school or play; short or long, for either trousers or lederhosen. \nAfter the \ufb01rst few teasing episodes from the other boys, Erwin had sorted his socks into two sepa-\nrate drawers. He placed all the black socks in one drawer and all the white socks in another drawer. \nErwin \ufb01gured he could determine an individual sock\u2019s length in the dark of night simply by feel-\ning it, but he had to have them presorted into white and black because the apartment generally lost \npower before the call to the shelter.\nUnfortunately, Erwin found that this presorting of the socks by color was ineffective. Whenever \nhe reached into the white sock drawer and chose two long socks, or two short socks, there was a 50% \nprobability of any one sock being black or white. The results from the black sock drawer were the \nsame. The socks seemed to have \u201cforgotten\u201d the color that Erwin had determined previously.\nErwin also tried sorting the socks into two drawers based upon their length, without regard to \ncolor. When he chose black or white socks from these long and short drawers, the socks had also \u201cfor-\ngotten\u201d whether they were long or short.\nAfter these fruitless attempts to solve his problem through experiments, Erwin decided to save \nhimself the fashion embarrassment, and he replaced his sock collection with a set of medium length \nbrown socks. However, he continued to ponder the mysteries of the socks throughout his childhood.\nAfter many years of daydreaming about the mystery socks, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger proposed his the-\nory of \u201cQuantum Socks\u201d and become famous. And that is the beginning of the story of the quantum \nsocks.\nThe End.\nFarfetched??"

The Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrated that measurements on microscopic \nor quantum particles are not always as certain as we might expect. Quantum particles behave as mys-\nteriously as Erwin\u2019s socks\u2014sometimes forgetting what we have already measured. Erwin\u2019s adven-\nture with the mystery socks is farfetched because you know that everyday objects do not behave like \nhis socks. If you observe a sock to be black, it remains black no matter what other properties of the \nsock you observe. However, the Stern- \nGerlach experiment goes against these ideas. Microscopic or \nquantum particles do not behave like the classical objects of your everyday experience. The act of \nobserving a quantum particle affects its measurable properties in a way that is foreign to our classical \nexperience.\nIn these \ufb01rst three chapters, we focus on the Stern-Gerlach experiment because it is a conceptu-\nally simple experiment that demonstrates many basic principles of quantum mechanics. We discuss \na variety of experimental results and the quantum theory that has been developed to predict those \nresults. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is based upon six postulates that we will \nintroduce as we develop the theoretical framework. (A complete list of these postulates is in Section 1.5.) \nWe use the Stern-Gerlach experiment to learn about quantum mechanics theory for two primary reasons: \n(1) It demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in principle by illustrating the postulates of quan-\ntum mechanics, and (2) it demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in practice through the use \nof Dirac notation and matrix mechanics to solve problems. By using a simple example, we can focus \non the principles and the new mathematics, rather than having the complexity of the physics obscure \nthese new aspects.\n1.1 \u0002 STERN-GERLACH EXPERIMENT\nIn 1922 Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach performed a seminal experiment in the history of quantum \nmechanics. In its simplest form, the experiment consisted of an oven that produced a beam of neu-\ntral atoms, a region of space with an inhomogeneous magnetic \ufb01eld, and a detector for the atoms, as \ndepicted in Fig. 1.1. Stern and Gerlach used a beam of silver atoms and found that the beam was split \ninto two in its passage through the magnetic \ufb01eld. One beam was de\ufb02ected upwards and one down-\nwards in relation to the direction of the magnetic \ufb01eld gradient.\nTo understand why this result is so at odds with our classical expectations, we must \ufb01rst analyze \nthe experiment classically. The results of the experiment suggest an interaction between a neutral parti-\ncle and a magnetic \ufb01eld. We expect such an interaction if the particle possesses a magnetic moment M.\nThe potential energy of this interaction is E = -M~B, which results in a force F = \u00021M~B2."

We could have chosen any other axis and we would \nhave obtained the same results.\nNow that we know the \ufb01ne details of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we simplify the experiment \nfor the rest of our discussions by focusing on the essential features. A simpli\ufb01ed schematic representa-\ntion of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1.2, which depicts an oven that produces the beam of atoms, a \nStern-Gerlach device with two output ports for the two possible values of the spin component, and two \ncounters to detect the atoms leaving the output ports of the Stern-Gerlach device. The Stern-Gerlach \ndevice is labeled with the axis along which the magnetic \ufb01eld is oriented. The up and down arrows \nindicate the two possible measurement results for the device; they correspond respectively to the \nresults Sz = {U>2 in the case where the \ufb01eld is oriented along the z-axis.

We assume that if no subscript is present on the quantum ket 1e.g., 0  +92, then the \nspin component is along the z-axis. This use of the z-axis as the default is a common convention \nthroughout our work and also in much of physics.\nA few items are noteworthy about this experiment. First, we notice that there are still only two \npossible outputs of the second Stern-Gerlach analyzer. The fact that it is aligned along a different axis \ndoesn\u2019t affect the fact that we get only two possible results for the case of a spin-1/2 particle. Second, \nit turns out that the results of this experiment would be unchanged if we used the lower port of the \ufb01rst \nanalyzer. That is, atoms entering the second analyzer in state 0  -9 would also result in half the atoms \nin each of the 0 {9x output ports. Finally, we cannot predict which of the second analyzer output ports \nany particular atom will come out. This can be demonstrated in actual experiments by recording the \nindividual counts out of each port. The arrival sequences at any counter are completely random. We \ncan say only that there is a 50% probability that an atom from the second analyzer will exit the upper \nanalyzer port and a 50% probability that it will exit the lower port. The random arrival of atoms at the \ndetectors can be seen clearly in the SPINS program simulations.\nThis probabilistic nature is at the heart of quantum mechanics. One might be tempted to say that \nwe just don\u2019t know enough about the system to predict which port the atom will exit. That is to say, \nthere may be some other variables, of which we are ignorant, that would allow us to predict the results. \nSuch a viewpoint is known as a local hidden variable theory. John Bell proved that such theories are \nnot compatible with the experimental results of quantum mechanics. The conclusion to draw from this \nis that even though quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, it is a complete description of reality. \nWe will have more to say about this in Chapter 4.\nNote that the 50% probability referred to above is the probability that an atom input to the second \nanalyzer exits one particular output port.

Because the spin-1/2 system has only two possible measurement results, these two prob-\nabilities must sum to unity\u2014there is a 100% probability of recording some value in the experiment. \nThis basic rule of probabilities is why the rules of quantum mechanics require that all state vectors \nbe properly normalized before they are used in any calculation of probabilities.

Note that the conven-\ntion is to put the input or initial state on the right and the output or \ufb01nal state on the left: 8out0 in9, so \none would read from right to left in describing a problem. Because the probability involves the com-\nplex square of the amplitude, and 8out0 in9 = 8in0 out9*, this convention is not critical for calculat-\ning probabilities.

We learned how to predict the probabilities of \nthese measurements using the basis kets of the spin component observables Sx, Sy, and Sz, and these \npredictions agreed with the experiments. However, the real power of a theory is its ability to predict \nresults of experiments that you haven\u2019t yet done. For example, what are the possible results of a mea-\nsurement of the spin component Sn along an arbitrary direction n\nn and what are the predicted probabili-\nties? To make these predictions, we need to learn about the operators of quantum mechanics.\n2.1 \u0002 OPERATORS, EIGENVALUES, AND EIGENVECTORS\nThe mathematical theory we developed in Chapter 1 used only quantum state vectors. We said that \nthe state vector represents all the information we can know about the system and we used the state \nvectors to calculate probabilities. With each observable Sx, Sy, and Sz we associated a pair of kets \n \ncorresponding to the possible measurement results of that observable.

This precession of the spin vector makes it clear \nthat the system has angular momentum, as opposed to simply having a magnetic dipole moment. The \nequivalence of the classical Larmor precession and the expectation value of the quantum mechanical \nspin vector is one example of Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem, which states that quantum mechanical expecta-\ntion values obey classical laws.\nPrecession experiments like the one discussed here are of great practical value. For example, if \nwe measure the magnetic \ufb01eld strength and the precession frequency, then the gyromagnetic ratio can \nbe determined. This spin precession problem is also of considerable theoretical utility because it is \nmathematically equivalent to many other quantum systems that can be modeled as two-state systems. \nThis utility is broader than you might guess at \ufb01rst glance, because many multistate quantum systems \ncan be reduced to two-state systems if the experiment is designed to interact only with two of the many \nlevels of the system.\nExample 3.1 A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment is prepared in the state 0  -9x and is \nsubject to a uniform applied magnetic \ufb01eld B = B0\n z\nn."

In 1930, the neutrino was pos-\ntulated by Wolfgang Pauli as a solution to the beta decay problem. A free neutron decays to a proton \nand an electron with a lifetime of about 10 minutes in the most basic beta decay process. However, the \ndecay scheme n S p + e- violates conservation of angular momentum, and experimental data sug-\ngest that conservation of energy is also violated. That\u2019s not good. Rather than reject these two basic \nconservation laws, as some suggested, Pauli proposed that a third particle is involved in the decay \nprocess. Enrico Fermi named this new particle the \u201cneutrino.\u201d Fermi developed a theory that used the \nneutrino to properly explain beta decay, but it was 25 more years before a neutrino was detected.\nNeutrinos are uncharged, relativistic particles. In nuclear beta decay, neutrinos are produced in \nprocesses such as\n \nn S p + e- + ne  \n \np S n + e+ + ne, \n \n(3.68)\nwhere the subscript labels the neutrino ne as an electron neutrino and the bar labels ne as an antineu-\ntrino. In the standard model of particle physics, neutrinos are massless, like photons. Neutrinos are so \nelusive because they interact via the weak force or weak interaction, which is the weakest of the four \nfundamental forces\u2014the strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity being the other three.\nThe reaction p S n + e+ + ne is part of the thermonuclear reaction chain in the sun and other \nstars, so we earthlings are constantly bombarded with neutrinos along with the essential photons we \nreceive from the sun. In the 1960s and 70s, landmark experiments indicated that there are only about \nhalf as many solar neutrinos arriving on earth as we would expect, given reliable models of stellar ther-\nmonuclear reactions. This solar neutrino problem has recently been solved by experiments detecting \nneutrinos from the sun and from nuclear reactors that demonstrate that neutrinos have nonzero mass. \nThese results are counter to the standard model and so have profound implications for particle physics \nand cosmology. Understanding how these experiments provide information on the neutrino mass is a \npowerful illustration of the applicability of Rabi\u2019s formula to other two-state systems.\nIn addition to the electron neutrinos in Eq. (3.68), there are other types of neutrinos associated \nwith other reactions, such as\n \n \np+ S m+ + nm\n \n \n \nm- S e- + nm + ne, \n \n(3.69)\nwhich represent the decay of a pion (p) to a muon (m) and the decay of a muon to an electron, respectively. \nA muon behaves exactly like an electron but has a larger mass.

Such \nchanges are called neutrino mixing or neutrino oscillations.\nThe labeling of neutrinos according to their association with electrons or muons arises from their behavior \nin the weak interaction processes described above. In other words, the quantum states 0 ne9 and 0 nm9 are \neigenstates of the Hamiltonian describing the weak interaction. However, when neutrinos propagate in \nfree space, the weak interaction is not relevant and the only Hamiltonian of relevance is that due to the \nrelativistic energy of the particles, which includes their rest masses and momenta.

The Larmor frequency \ndepends on the magnetic \ufb01eld magnitude at the location of the particular nucleus being studied. This \nmagnetic \ufb01eld includes the applied external \ufb01eld and any internal \ufb01elds created by the local environ-\nment, such that measuring the resonance frequency provides valuable information about the environ-\nment of the nucleus.

The probabilistic \nnature of quantum mechanics does not agree with the certainty of the classical world\u2014we have no \ndoubt that the sun will rise tomorrow. Moreover, the disturbance of a quantum mechanical system \nthrough the action of measurement makes us part of the system, rather than an independent observer. \nThese issues and others make us wonder what is really going on in the quantum world. As quantum \nmechanics was being developed in the early twentieth century, many of the world\u2019s greatest physicists \ndebated the \u201ctrue meaning\u201d of quantum mechanics. They often developed gedanken experiments or \nthought experiments to illustrate their ideas. Some of these gedanken experiments have now actually \nbeen performed and some are still being pursued.\nIn this chapter, we present a few of the gedanken and real experiments that demonstrate the \nspookiness of quantum mechanics. We present enough details to give a \ufb02avor of the spookiness and \nprovide references for further readings on these topics at the end of the chapter.\n4.1 \u0002  \nEINSTEIN-PODOLSKY-ROSEN PARADOX\nAlbert Einstein was never comfortable with quantum mechanics. He is famously quoted as saying \n\u201cGott w\u00fcrfelt nicht\u201d or \u201cGod does not play dice,\u201d to express his displeasure with the probabilistic \nnature of quantum mechanics. But his opposition to quantum mechanics ran deeper than that. He felt \nthat properties of physical objects have an objective reality independent of their measurement, much \nas Erwin felt that his socks were black or white, or long or short, independent of his pulling them out \nof the drawer. In quantum mechanics, we cannot say that a particle whose spin is measured to be up \nhad that property before the measurement. It may well have been in a superposition state. Moreover, \nwe can only know one spin component of a particle, because measurement of one component disturbs \nour knowledge of the other components. Because of these apparent de\ufb01ciencies, Einstein believed that \nquantum mechanics was an incomplete description of reality.\nIn 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen published a paper presenting a gedan-\nken experiment designed to expose the shortcomings of quantum mechanics. The EPR Paradox \n(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) tries to paint quantum mechanics into a corner and expose the \u201cabsurd\u201d \nbehavior of the theory. The essence of the argument is that if you believe that measurements on two \nwidely separated particles cannot in\ufb02uence each other, then the quantum mechanics of an ingeniously \nprepared two-particle system leads you to conclude that the physical properties of each particle are \nreally there\u2014they are elements of reality in the authors\u2019 words.\n"

Because the particles are widely separated, this element of reality must be independent \nof what observer A does, and hence, must have existed all along. The independence of the elements of \nreality of the two  \nparticles is called Einstein\u2019s locality principle, and is a fundamental assumption of \nthe EPR argument.\nThe correlation of spin measurements of the two observers is independent of the choice of mea-\nsurement direction, assuming the same direction for both observers. That is, if observer A measures \nthe x-component of spin and records S1x = +U>2, then we know with 100% certainty that observer B \nwill measure S2x = -U>2. Observer A is free to choose to measure S1x, S1y, or S1z, so EPR argue that \nS2x, S2y, and S2z must all be elements of reality for particle 2. However, quantum mechanics maintains \nthat we can know only one spin component at a time for a single particle. EPR conclude that quantum \nmechanics is an incomplete description of physical reality because it does not describe all the elements \nof reality of the particle.\nIf the EPR argument is correct, then the elements of reality, which are also called hidden vari-\nables or instruction sets, are really there, but for some reason we cannot know all of them at once. \nThus, one can imagine constructing a local hidden variable theory wherein there are different types of \nparticles with different instruction sets that determine the results of measurements. The theory is local \nbecause the instruction sets are local to each particle so that measurements by the two observers are \nindependent. The populations or probabilities of the different instruction sets can be properly adjusted \nin a local hidden variable theory to produce results consistent with quantum mechanics. Because quan-\ntum mechanics and a local hidden variable theory cannot be distinguished by experiment, the question \nof which is correct is then left to the realm of metaphysics. For many years, this was what many physi-\ncists believed. After all, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to believe that there are things we cannot know!\nHowever, in 1964, John Bell showed that the hidden variables that we cannot know cannot even \nbe there! Bell showed that there are speci\ufb01c measurements that can be made to distinguish between a \nlocal hidden variable theory and quantum mechanics. The results of these quantum mechanics experi-\nments are not compatible with any local hidden variable theory. Bell derived a very general relation, \nbut we present a speci\ufb01c one here for simplicity.\nBell\u2019s argument relies on observers A and B making measurements along a set of different direc-\ntions. Consider three directions a\nn, b\nn, c\nn in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.2, each 120\u00b0 from any of the other \ntwo. Each observer makes measurements of the spin projection along one of these three directions, \nchosen randomly. Any single observer\u2019s result can be only spin up or spin down along that direction, \nbut we record the results independent of the direction of the Stern-Gerlach analyzers, so we denote \none observer\u2019s result simply as  \n+ or  \n-, without noting the axis of measurement.

The results of exper-\niments performed on systems that produce entangled quantum states have consistently agreed with \nquantum mechanics and hence, exclude the possibility of local hidden variable theories. We are forced \nto conclude that quantum mechanics is an inherently nonlocal theory.\nThe EPR paradox also raises issues regarding the collapse of the quantum state and how a mea-\nsurement by A can instantaneously alter the quantum state at B. However, there is no information \ntransmitted instantaneously and so there is no violation of relativity. What observer B measures is not \naffected by any measurements that A makes. The two observers notice only when they get together \nand compare results that some of the measurements (along the same axes) are correlated.\nThe entangled states of the EPR paradox have truly nonclassical behavior and so appear spooky \nto our classically trained minds. But when you are given lemons, make lemonade. Modern quantum \nresearchers are now using the spookiness of the entangled states to enable new technologies that take \nadvantage of the way that quantum mechanics stores information in these correlated systems. Quan-\ntum computers, quantum communication, and quantum information processing in general are active \nareas of research and promise to enable a new revolution in information technology.\n \n4.2 \u0002 SCHR\u00d6DINGER CAT PARADOX\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger cat paradox is a gedanken experiment designed by Schr\u00f6dinger to illustrate some of \nthe problems of quantum measurement, particularly in the extension of quantum mechanics to classi-\ncal systems. The apparatus of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s gedanken experiment consists of a radioactive nucleus, a \nGeiger counter, a hammer, a bottle of cyanide gas, a cat, and a box, as shown in Fig. 4.3. The nucleus \nhas a 50% probability of decaying in one hour. The components are assembled such that when the \nnucleus decays, it triggers the Geiger counter, which causes the hammer to break the bottle and release \nthe poisonous gas, killing the cat. Thus, after one hour there is a 50% probability that the cat is dead.\nAfter the one hour, the nucleus is in an equal superposition of undecayed and decayed states:\n \n0 cnucleus9 =\n1\n12 10 cundecayed9 + 0\n cdecayed92. \n(4.12)\nThe apparatus is designed such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the undecayed \nnuclear state and the live-cat state and a one-to-one correspondence between the decayed nuclear state \nand the dead-cat state. Though the cat is macroscopic, it is made up of microscopic particles and so \nshould be describable by a quantum state, albeit a complicated one. Thus, we expect that the quantum \nstate of the cat after one hour is\n \n0 ccat9 =\n1\n12 10 calive9 + 0 cdead92. \n(4.13)\n"

However, quantum mechanics would lead us to \nbelieve that the cat was neither dead nor alive before we opened the box, but rather was in a super-\nposition of states, and the quantum state collapses to the alive state 0 calive9 or dead state 0 cdead9 only \nwhen we open the box and make the measurement by observing the cat. But our classical experiences \nclearly run counter to this. We would say that the cat really was dead or alive, we just did not know \nit yet. (Imagine that the cat is wearing a cyanide sensitive watch\u2014the time will tell us when the cat \nwas killed, if it is dead!)\nWhy are we so troubled by a cat in a superposition state? After all, we have just \ufb01nished three \nchapters of electrons in superposition states! What is so inherently different about cats and electrons? \nExperiment 4 that we studied in Chapters 1 and 2 provides a clue. The superposition state in that \nexperiment exhibits a clear interference effect that relies on the coherent phase relationship between \nthe two parts of the superposition state vector for the spin-1/2 particle. No one has ever observed such \nan interference effect with cats, so our gut feeling that cats and electrons are different appears justi\ufb01ed.\nThe main issues raised by the Schr\u00f6dinger cat gedanken experiment are (1) Can we describe mac-\nroscopic states quantum mechanically? and (2) What causes the collapse of the wave function?\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics championed by Bohr and Heisenberg \nmaintains that there is a boundary between the classical and quantum worlds. We describe micro-\nscopic systems (the nucleus) with quantum states and macroscopic systems (the cat, or even the Gei-\nger counter) with classical rules. The measurement apparatus causes the quantum state to collapse and \nto produce the single classical or meter result. The actual mechanism for the collapse of the wave func-\ntion is not speci\ufb01ed in the Copenhagen interpretation, and where to draw the line between the classical \nand the quantum world is not clear. Others have argued that the human consciousness is responsible \nfor collapsing the wave function, while some have argued that there is no collapse, just bifurcation into \nalternate, independent universes. Many of these different points of view are untestable experimentally \nand thus raise more metaphysical than physical questions.\nThese debates about the interpretation of quantum mechanics arise when we use words, which \nare based on our classical experiences, to describe the quantum world.

With a \ufb01rm foundation in how quantum mechanics works, we are ready to address the \ncentral question that quantum mechanics was designed to answer: How do we explain the structure of \nthe microscopic world? All around us are nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids with unique properties \nthat cannot be explained with classical physics but require quantum mechanics. For example, quantum \nmechanics can tell us why sodium lamps are yellow, why laser diodes have a unique color, and why \nuranium is radioactive.\nThe key to understanding the structure of microscopic systems lies in the energy states that the \nsystems are allowed to have. Each microscopic system has a unique set of energy levels that gives that \nsystem a \u201c\ufb01ngerprint\u201d that sets it apart from other systems. With the tools of quantum mechanics, we \ncan build a theoretical model for the system, predict that \ufb01ngerprint, and compare it to the experimen-\ntal measurement. Our goal in this chapter and the ones that follow is to learn how to predict this energy \n\ufb01ngerprint. In this chapter we will study a particularly simple model system that exhibits most of the \nimportant features that are shared by all microscopic systems.\n5.1 \u0002 SPECTROSCOPY\nThe energy \ufb01ngerprint of a system not only identi\ufb01es that system uniquely, but the allowed energies \ndetermine the time evolution of the system through the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, as we learned in Chapter 3. \nOne of the primary experimental techniques for measuring the energy \ufb01ngerprint of a system is spectros-\ncopy. We saw a hint of this in the magnetic resonance example of Section 3.4: absorption and emission of \nphotons causes transitions between quantized energy levels of the system only when the photon energy \nmatches the spacing between the energy eigenstates. Historically, the spectrum of hydrogen was a key \ningredient in the development of quantum mechanics, and spectroscopy continues to play an important \nrole in characterizing new quantum systems and in verifying the rules of quantum mechanics.\nIn the magnetic resonance example of Section 3.4, the two quantized energy levels arose from the \ntwo possible spin components (up or down) and their different interactions with an applied magnetic \n\ufb01eld. The more common situation that gives rise to quantized energy levels is where two or more \nparticles interact in a way that limits their spatial motion and binds them together into a compos-\nite system. Bound systems such as nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids are everyday examples that \nare characterized by distinct spectral lines associated with quantized energy states, (i.e., eigenstates \nof the Hamiltonian with discrete energy eigenvalues)."

Completeness means \nthat we can use these basis functions to construct all possible solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation \nH0 c9 = iU d 0 c9>dt for this problem. The wave function of a general superposition state is\n \nc1x2 = a\nn\ncn\n wn1x2. \n(5.100)\nNote that the energy eigenvalue equation Hwn1x2 = En\n wn1x2 is satis\ufb01ed by each particular energy \neigenstate in turn but is not satis\ufb01ed by general superposition states.

Obviously, for a well that is so small that there is only one bound state, we would \nexpect to need more states to form a complete basis.

In quantum mechan-\nics, we do this through the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n \nH0 c9 = iU d\ndt\n 0 c9 \n(5.102)\nthat governs the time evolution of any quantum system. Though different systems clearly have differ-\nent Hamiltonians, we need not solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the time evolution separately for \neach system. We have already solved it in Chapter 3 for a time-independent Hamiltonian, where we \nfound that the most general time-dependent solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is\n \n0 c1t29 = a\nn\ncn\n e-iEnt>U0 En9. \n(5.103)\nThat is, the energy eigenstates form the preferred basis in which to expand a general quantum state \nvector, with the time evolution determined by phase factors dependent on the energy of each compo-\nnent state. In a general superposition, each energy eigenstate acquires a different phase. It is critical \nto remember that one must use the energy basis in order to use this simple recipe for time evolu-\ntion. This is why we spend much of our time \ufb01nding energy eigenstates.\nTo use Eq. (5.103) we need to know the expansion coef\ufb01cients cn for the particular state in ques-\ntion.

We can show that \nthis is so by using our prescription for writing a probability amplitude in wave function language as an \noverlap integral. The momentum space wave function f1 p2 is a probability amplitude f1 p2 = 8p0 c9, \nand the rule for converting a Dirac bra-ket projection to wave function overlap integral is to convert the \nket 0 c9 to a wave function c1x2, the bra 8p0  to a wave function conjugate w*\np1x2 = e-i px>U> 12pU, and \nthen integrate over all space.

We choose one \u201ccentral\u201d state \nwith momentum p0 to have twice the amplitude of two \u201cside mode\u201d states that are equally spaced at \np = p0 { dp about the central state, as shown in the momentum state distribution in Fig. 6.3. As the \ndashed line hints, we are using this three-mode superposition as a model of a continuous momentum \ndistribution characterized by a center momentum p0 and a momentum distribution width dp that we \nwill discuss in Section 6.2.2.\nA graphical representation of this three-state superposition of sinusoidal waves and the resultant \nwave is shown in Fig. 6.4. The different wavelengths of the three components lead to constructive and \ndestructive interference, as indicated in the plots. The resultant wave is localized to a region of space \nand hence is referred to as a wave packet. The wave packet shown in Fig. 6.4 has a characteristic \nwavelength determined by the central momentum, so it resembles a wave, but it also has a limited spa-\ntial extent, and so it also resembles a particle. In this case, we are using a discrete Fourier sum, so this \nlocalization is repeated periodically. For the more realistic continuum distribution, only one localized \nregion exists and a true wave packet is realized. The coexisting particle and wave characteristics of a \nwave packet are the essence of the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics.\nTo understand the motion of the wave packet, we must study the time evolution.

In the general solution then, \nthe Aeik1x term represents the incoming projectile particles, as illustrated in Fig. 6.14."

The coef\ufb01cient A represents the amplitude \nof the incoming wave, B the amplitude of the re\ufb02ected wave, and F the amplitude of the transmitted \nwave, all of which are things we can measure. But we only expect our theory to predict the amplitudes \nof the re\ufb02ected and transmitted waves. The amplitude of the incident wave is something we control \nin the experiment. Moreover, we expect that more incoming wave amplitude (input particle \ufb02ux) will \nlead to more re\ufb02ected and transmitted wave amplitude (output particle \ufb02ux), so we really want to \npredict the ratios B>A and F>A of the re\ufb02ected and transmitted waves, respectively, to the incoming \nwave.

Some aspects of the experiment are consistent with a \nparticle model, while others are consistent with a wave model. The quantum mechanical resolution is \nto say that we use the wave model to predict the probabilities of detecting individual particles. This \nis consistent with the interpretation we used in the spins sections where the quantum state vector was \nused to predict the probability that a spin projection was measured to be up or down. So what we called \nthe light intensity in the classical wave description is now transformed into a probability of detecting \nphotons at particular places on the screen. Any given photon arrival occurs randomly on the screen and \nthe pattern builds up only after many arrivals. This is what we mean by wave-particle duality.

As hard as \nyou might try, you cannot measure, and therefore cannot know, which slit the \u201cparticle\u201d goes through \nwithout disturbing it just a little bit. The simplest way to measure which slit the particle goes through \nis to watch, but you need some light to watch. If you see the particle, then at least one photon must \nhave scattered from the particle toward your eye, and the change in momentum of that photon in the \nscattering process will (through conservation of momentum) impart an equal and opposite change to \nthe particle\u2019s momentum. This change is enough to alter the phase of the particle\u2019s wave function and \ndestroy the interference fringes. In the early days of quantum mechanics, such \u201cwhich path\u201d experi-\nments were merely \u201cthought\u201d experiments or gedanken experiments because they were too hard to \nperform. However, in recent years careful experiments have demonstrated these effects beyond doubt.\nOne of the important features of an atom interferometer is its ability to measure extremely small \nchanges in potential energy. This ability arises from the dependence of the de Broglie wavelength of \nthe particle on the potential energy. If the potential energy varies, then the kinetic energy and hence the \nmomentum varies because the energy is conserved. The de Broglie wavelength depends on the particle \nmomentum, so a varying potential gives rises to a varying wavelength\n \n \nldB = h\np\n \n \n =\nh\n22m1E - V2\n ."

However, we found a matrix representation to \nbe useful previously, for example in the discussion of spin states. Can we use a matrix representation \nfor the harmonic oscillator case? It turns out that we can. A matrix representation is a collection of \nnumbers that represents states and operators in terms of a chosen basis set. So we must \ufb01rst choose \na basis for the matrix representation. We have just solved for the energy basis states of the harmonic \noscillator, so that choice seems reasonable, especially in light of the importance of the energy basis in \nthe Schr\u00f6dinger time evolution recipe. So how do we \ufb01nd the numbers we need to represent states and \noperators as matrices in the energy representation? We do it by inspection!\nWe learned in Section 2.1 that an operator is always diagonal in its own basis, and eigenvec-\ntors are unit vectors in their own basis. So the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the energy basis and the \nenergy eigenstates are unit vectors in the energy basis. The diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian \nare the energy eigenvalues, so by inspection of our energy result in Eq.

The Morse energy \nlevels become closer together near the top of the well, in contrast to the uniform spacing of the har-\nmonic oscillator. This difference has a clear signature in the spectra of molecular vibrations. An ideal \nharmonic oscillator has transitions only between adjacent energy levels 1\u0006n = {1 selection rule from \nSection 9.8), and all those possible transitions have the same energy difference U v. The transitions in a \nMorse oscillator exhibit a progression from the n = 0 4 1 transition at energy U v to smaller energies \nas we progress up the potential well. In addition, a Morse oscillator has allowed transitions between \nnonadjacent states 1\u0006n = {2, 3, ...2 at higher energies near to multiples of the harmonic energy U v. \nThe \u0006n = {1 selection rule is not obeyed because of the anharmonicity of the well, though these tran-\nsitions are typically weaker than the \u0006n = {1 transitions.\nThe spectra observed in molecules are further complicated by the rotation of the molecule that we \nstudied in Chapter 7, and by transitions between different electronic levels, similar to the transitions in \nthe hydrogen atom we studied in Chapter 8. The transitions due to changes in electronic, vibrational, \nand rotational levels are each characterized by a different energy scale.

Unfortunately, those problems represent a small fraction of the realistic problems that \nnature presents to us, and in most cases those exactly solvable problems are only approximations to \nreal problems. Now we must learn to solve more realistic problems that do not admit exact solutions. \nThe approach we take to solving these realistic problems is to make them look like problems we have \nalready solved exactly, with an additional part that represents the new, more realistic aspect of the \nproblem. We assume that this new part, the perturbation, is small so that we can use approximations \nto \ufb01nd the corrections to the exact solutions. Our focus is to discover how energies and eigenstates are \naffected by small additional terms in the Hamiltonian. To guide us, we will take some exactly solv-\nable problems, solve them, and then expand the solutions. We will compare these results with the new \nperturbation methods that we learn.\nWe had a sneak peek at how a perturbation affects a system in Chapter 5 when we studied the \nasymmetric square well. We saw that an additional potential energy \u201cshelf\u201d in the in\ufb01nite square well \nchanged the energy levels, as shown in Fig. 10.1. For small values V0 of the potential energy shelf, \nthe energy of the ground state is shifted by an amount that is linearly dependent on V0, but as the \nperturbation increases, the energy begins to change quadratically. This linear-to-quadratic behavior \nis a common feature of perturbation theory and will be evident as we proceed.

We\u2019ll skip that calculation and move on to \nexcited hydrogen states that require degenerate perturbation theory.\nThe n \u0003 2 state of the hydrogen atom is fourfold degenerate, with one 2s state and three 2p states. \nDegenerate perturbation theory tells us to diagonalize the perturbation Hamiltonian in the degenerate \nsubspace. To do this, we \ufb01rst need to \ufb01nd the matrix representing the Stark effect perturbation within \nthe subspace of the four degenerate states.

These additional energy lev-\nels arise from a variety of perturbations to the zeroth-order Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian. In this \nchapter, we focus on the hyper\ufb01ne structure, so named because its effects are smaller than another \neffect called the \ufb01ne structure. Studying hyper\ufb01ne structure in the hydrogen atom gives us a chance to \nuse perturbation theory to calculate an important energy and also gives us a chance to learn some new \nangular momentum tools. In Example 10.4, we found that we could have solved the problem more \neasily if we had chosen the \u201ccorrect\u201d basis at the start of the problem. The \u201ccorrect\u201d basis is not so \nmuch correct as it is convenient because the perturbation Hamiltonian is already diagonal in that basis \nand we avoid the tedious diagonalization required by degenerate perturbation theory. The hyper\ufb01ne \nstructure calculation presents us with a similar scenario, but not yet knowing how to choose the most \nconvenient basis, we will solve the hyper\ufb01ne problem by brute force in the \u201cinconvenient\u201d basis and \nthen analyze the results to learn how to choose bases. The two bases for the hyper\ufb01ne problem are the \nuncoupled and coupled bases, which refer to the coupling or addition of angular momenta. The \ntheory of the addition of angular momenta complements perturbation theory to allow us to more easily \nsolve for the many rich details in the hydrogen atom, which we will continue in the next chapter.\n11.1 \u0002 HYPERFINE INTERACTION\nThe hyper\ufb01ne interaction between the electron and the nucleus arises from higher electromagnetic \nmultipole moments of the nucleus, beyond the electric monopole moment (i.e., charge) that is already \nincluded in the Coulomb interaction. The dominant hyper\ufb01ne effect is due to the magnetic moment of \nthe nucleus and its interaction with the internal magnetic \ufb01elds in the atom caused by the electron\u2019s \norbital motion and by the electron\u2019s spin magnetic moment. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the \nelectron associated with its spin is\n \nMe = -ge e\n2me\n S = -ge\n mB S\nU , \n(11.1)\nwhere the gyromagnetic ratio ge is approximately 2 and the Bohr magneton is mB = e U>2me. The \nproton is also a spin-1/2 particle and has an associated magnetic moment. We label the proton spin, \nand nuclear spin in general, as I, so the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton is\n \nMp = gp e\n2mp\n I = gp\n mN I\nU, \n(11.2)\n"

As we discussed when we derived \ndegenerate perturbation theory, if we are clever enough to choose the right basis for  \nrepresenting the \nperturbation Hamiltonian at the start of a problem, then the matrix is already diagonal and the prob-\nlem is solved.

Nobel Laureates Arthur Schawlow and Theodor \nH\u00e4nsch made important advances in hydrogen atom spectroscopy and noted that, \u201cThe spectrum of \nthe hydrogen atom has proved to be the Rosetta stone of modern physics: once this pattern of lines \nhad been deciphered much else could also be understood.\u201d The scienti\ufb01c process whereby advances in \nexperimental precision of spectroscopic measurements have led to advances in theoretical understand-\ning of the hydrogen atom has been repeated throughout the last century. State of the art techniques \nnow permit the energy levels of the hydrogen atom to be measured with 15 digits of precision, provid-\ning one of the best testing grounds for quantum theory.\nIn Chapter 10, we studied the Stark effect\u2014the perturbation of hydrogen energy levels by an \nexternal electric \ufb01eld. In Chapter 11, we studied the hyper\ufb01ne interaction\u2014the perturbation of hydro-\ngen energy levels by the magnetic interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin. In this \nchapter we study further magnetic perturbations\u2014due to both external and internal magnetic \ufb01elds. \nThe internal \ufb01elds give rise to the \ufb01ne structure of the hydrogen energy levels and to the hyper\ufb01ne \nstructure that we have already studied. The external \ufb01elds give rise to the Zeeman effect\u2014the mag-\nnetic analog to the Stark effect. We also study internal perturbations due to relativistic effects, which \nare part of the \ufb01ne structure. We treat all of these effects as small perturbations to the hydrogen energy \nlevels we found in Chapter 8. It is possible to treat some of the internal perturbations exactly using the \nrelativistic Dirac equation, but that is beyond the scope of this text.\n12.1 \u0002 HYDROGEN ENERGY LEVELS\nLet\u2019s review what we know about the energy levels of hydrogen.

The energy levels are labeled with \na modi\ufb01ed spectroscopic notation n 2S+1L [see Eq. (11.84)], with n being the state of the excited elec-\ntron. The J label is suppressed because it has no bearing on the energy at this order of approximation. \nWe understand the singlet-triplet ordering of the energy levels by noting that in the singlet state, the \nspin state is antisymmetric and the spatial state is symmetric, implying that the two electrons get closer \nto each other and therefore increase the repulsive Coulomb potential energy. In the triplet state, the \nspin state is symmetric, the spatial state is antisymmetric, and the two electrons are farther apart, thus \nlowering the Coulomb potential energy.\nThis ordering of the energy levels, with the singlet state above the triplet state, is evident through-\nout the excited states of helium. Another important feature of the singlet and triplet states is that opti-\ncal transitions between these states are forbidden. The electromagnetic light \ufb01eld does not couple to \nthe spin, so the selection rules for optical transitions require there to be no change in the spin quantum \nnumber between two states. Hence, transitions between the singlet and triplet states of helium are \nforbidden, and it was originally believed that there were two types of helium: parahelium 1S = 02 \nand orthohelium 1S = 12."

In those examples, the Hamiltonian \nwas not time dependent, so the perturbed energy levels were still stationary states of the system. Now \nwe turn to the problem of understanding how a system responds to changes in the Hamiltonian that are \na function of time. We will \ufb01nd that the new perturbed energy states are no longer stationary states and \nthat changes or transitions between states can occur. In Chapter 3, we solved the time-dependent case \nexactly for a sinusoidal perturbation of the two-level spin system. We found that spin \ufb02ips or transi-\ntions between spin up and down states occur when the frequency of the time dependence is close to the \nBohr frequency characterizing the energy splitting of the two states. This resonance condition is also \nan important idea in this chapter.\nThe transitions between energy states that arise from a time-dependent Hamiltonian play a major \nrole in experimental studies of quantum mechanical systems. We have referred many times to spec-\ntroscopic experiments that provide evidence of the energies of quantum systems. These spectroscopic \nexperiments rely on the interaction between the oscillating electromagnetic \ufb01elds of laser beams and \natoms or molecules that respond to these time-dependent \ufb01elds. The examples in this chapter will help \nus better understand these light-matter interactions.\n14.1 \u0002 TRANSITION PROBABILITY\nThe typical experiment that we wish to model with time-dependent perturbation theory is the fol-\nlowing: we start with a system in a particular initial quantum state 0 i9, we turn on a perturbing Ham-\niltonian H\u00041t2 at time t = 0, and then we measure the probability that the system is in a new \ufb01nal \nquantum state 0  f 9 at a later time. For example, a hydrogen atom in its ground state 0 1s9 is perturbed \nby an incident laser beam, and we wish to know the probability of the atom making a transition to \nthe 0 3p9 excited state. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be H0 before the perturbation, and as in time-\nindependent perturbation theory, we assume that we know the solutions to the unperturbed energy \neigenvalue equation:\n \nH00 n9 = En0 n9."

Negative b \nputs the energy minimum at k = 0 and the maxima at the Brillouin zone boundaries, and vice \nversa for positive b.\n15.9 \u0002 THE KRONIG-PENNEY MODEL\nThe \ufb01nal piece of the picture is to connect the LCAO approximation to the analytical, exact solution, \nwhich is possible for the simple case of a periodic chain of square wells. This example usually goes \nunder the name of the Kronig-Penney model.\nThe LCAO approximation lets us see the progression from the atomic wave functions and the \nenergy spectrum of isolated atoms to the band structure of a solid as the number of atoms becomes \nlarger and the interaction between the atoms becomes stronger. The Kronig-Penney model, on the \nother hand, simply solves the eigenvalue equation for the exact periodic potential. It is a more \u201ccor-\nrect\u201d approach, but lacks the intuitive connections to the atomic system. Moreover, in a real solid, the \nexact periodic potential is unknown, but the electronic energy levels and wave functions of atoms are \nnot too dif\ufb01cult to calculate, so the LCAO model can be a good starting point. Figure 15.16 presents \nthe LCAO dispersion relation, Eq. (15.24), and the exact dispersion relation that we are about to \ufb01nd \n[Eq. (15.61)], on the same plot. We see that the LCAO is a good approximation for the energies in the \nperiodic system, especially when the coupling between states in adjacent wells is not too large.\nSeveral excellent texts treat the Kronig-Penney example in great detail, and it is a good example \nto practice solving the energy eigenvalue equation. Here, we\u2019ll present a very broad overview, and \nconcentrate on the energy spectrum rather than the eigenstates. The periodic potential V is sketched \nin Fig. 15.17 and all the relevant lengths and energies are de\ufb01ned. The width of the well is b, the well \nspacing is a, and the well depth is V0."

On the other hand, if the transition is indirect, the electron\u2019s momentum changes by a signi\ufb01cant \nfraction of the Brillouin zone width, and the photon cannot supply the needed momentum. The neces-\nsary momentum comes from another lattice denizen, the phonon, or lattice vibration. In other words, \nthe lattice changes its mode of vibration to accommodate the electron transition. In probabilistic terms, \nit means that three entities must be present at the same place and time (the electron, the photon and the \nphonon), and this is a far less likely occurrence than a coincidence of just two particles, an electron \nand a photon. The upshot is that direct transitions are far more likely than indirect transitions.\nNow the phonon supplies the necessary momentum for an indirect transition, but it also brings \nalong some energy. However, the phonon energies are rather small compared to the gap energy, so one \nphonon alone is not suf\ufb01cient to allow an electron to make an interband transition.

Insulators are poor con-\nductors, because nearby-energy states are occupied by other electrons and no net momentum \nchange can occur. Semiconductors in this model are simply metals (partially \ufb01lled bands) \nwith very few charge carriers that are generated thermally.\n\u2022 Electron motion in solids is modeled with the use of a wave packet, a superposition of delo-\ncalized Bloch states of different k that peaks at a speci\ufb01c location.

This difference is parameterized by the \neffective mass, which describes the curvature of the E(k) relation. It is especially useful near \nthe maxima and minima of bands, where the dispersion relation is often parabolic, similar to \nthe dispersion relation of a free electron.\n\u2022 The density of states g(E) is the number of states per unit energy interval.

The force on \nthe atom is the negative gradient of the Zeeman energy, so atomic states with positive magnetic quan-\ntum number m are attracted toward regions of low magnetic \ufb01eld and are called weak-\ufb01eld seeking \nstates.

Laser cooling has been used to improve the \nprecision of atomic clocks, to make precision measurements of gravity, and to create sources of atoms \nthat behave as quantum mechanical waves rather than classical particles.

This shift is sure to be a disruptive in\ufb02uence in computing, but it also represents \nan opportunity to take advantage of unique quantum mechanical aspects of information processing.\nThe idea that quantum mechanics could be useful in computing stems in part from a talk and a \npaper by Richard Feynman in the early 1980\u2019s. Feynman asked the question: Can a classical computer \nreliably model a quantum mechanical system? Imagine that we want to model the quantum mechani-\ncal time evolution of a system of 50 spin-1/2 particles.

The classical N-bit system does have 2N possible states, but \nany single state contains just N pieces of information.\nThough the N-qubit superposition state contains 2N pieces of information, it is not possible to mea-\nsure it all. When we measure the state of the system, we destroy much of the information by collapsing \nthe system state vector onto the measured state. For example, if we measure the spin components of \nthe two particles described by Eq.

Even though there are 2N pieces of information in an \nN-qubit system, it turns out that we can extract only N pieces of classical information through our mea-\nsurements. You might ask whether we can call it information if we cannot know it! This question has \nspawned research into quantum information and how it differs from classical information. The trick of \nquantum computing is to harness the vast store of information that resides in the superposition state, \nbut is hidden from direct measurement. A number of algorithms have been discovered that access the \nhidden quantum information by performing operations that affect many or all of the qubits at once. By \nperforming these multiple operations simultaneously, we achieve quantum parallelism. You can also \nperform parallel computing with classical computers, but you do so by buying more computers!\nEntangled states\nThe power of quantum parallelism relies on the phenomenon of quantum entanglement that we intro-\nduced in Chapter 4.

Measuring one of the qubits affects the other, possibly dis-\ntant, qubit instantaneously. Rather than regarding these nonlocal correlations as spooky, we can use \nthem as a resource in quantum information processing. The nonlocal aspect of entangled states is \nuseful because we can act on one part of a system and control another part of the system, and we can \nmeasure one part to learn about another part or about the system as a whole. This is how quantum \nalgorithms are able to process the 2N pieces of information hidden in an N-qubit system.

It is no use having \nmore information available if we cannot access it after the calculation.\nThe importance of entangled states is also evident in our argument about the exponential increase \nin information content of a quantum superposition state. We said that the 2-qubit superposition state \n0\n c9 in Eq. (16.22) contains 22 = 4 pieces of information and that an N-qubit superposition contains \n2N pieces of information. However, there is a caveat to that statement. It turns out that there are some \nsuperposition states that have less information content because they can be expressed as a product of \n1-qubit states.

We\u2019ll \nleave it to you to explore the N = 3 case in Problem 16.8 and distinguish the difference. The take-\nhome message is that access to the power of quantum parallelism requires the use of entangled states.\nQuantum computing algorithms are designed to process the hidden information in the large Hilbert \nspace in a way that the desired result is brought out in the measured qubits. Two of the most impres-\nsive quantum algorithms are Shor\u2019s factorization algorithm and Grover\u2019s search algorithm. Factoring \na large number into its two prime factors is a dif\ufb01cult task for a classical computer. In 1994, Peter Shor \ndeveloped a quantum algorithm that \ufb01nds the prime factors of an integer in a time that is faster than a \nclassical computer by a factor that is exponential in the number of digits of the number being factored. \nBecause of the importance of factoring in encryption, Shor\u2019s algorithm has inspired many to try to build \na quantum computer. Grover\u2019s search algorithm allows a quantum computer to search an unsorted data-\nbase of N entries in a time proportional to 1N, compared to a classical computer that requires a time that \nis proportional to N. Details of these algorithms are available in the resources at the end of the chapter.\nQuantum algorithms are not immune to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. If we run \nthe same program twice on a quantum computer, then we might get two different answers. The power \nof quantum computing is that it can produce answers in many fewer steps than a classical computer. As \nlong as we can easily con\ufb01rm the answers on a classical computer, then the time advantage overcomes the \nneed to run the program many times. For example, as hard as it is to \ufb01nd prime factors of a large number, \nit is trivial to check whether the product of the two proposed factors do in fact yield the original number. \nLikewise, as hard as it is to \ufb01nd a needle in a haystack, it is simple to determine if the object you \ufb01nd is a \nneedle, so con\ufb01rming the result of a quantum search algorithm is straightforward on a classical computer.\n"

Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers to include an additional \nimaginary part. The imaginary number i is the square root of \u20131:\n \ni = 2-1. \n(B.1)\nA complex number has a real part and imaginary part and is written as\n \nz = a + ib, \n(B.2)\nwhere this form assumes that a and b are real values. We refer to a as the real part of z and b as the \nimaginary part of z, and denote them as\n \n \na = Re 1z2  \n \n \nb = Im 1z2. \n \n(B.3)\nWhen we add two complex numbers together, we must keep the real and imaginary parts separate:\n \nz1 + z2 = 1a1 + ib12 + 1a2 + ib22 = 1a1 + a22 + i1b1 + b22. \n(B.4)\nThis makes it clear that the real and imaginary parts are the \u201capples and oranges\u201d that you are often \ntold not to mix together. In fact, a complex number contains two independent pieces of information, \nmuch like the components of a vector. We even represent a complex number in a similar way, as \nshown in Fig. B.1.\nVisualization of complex numbers in this \u201ccomplex plane\u201d can be very powerful. The horizontal \naxis in Fig. B.1 corresponds to the real part of a complex number and the vertical axis corresponds to \nthe imaginary part. Expressing the complex number as z = a + ib corresponds to using the Cartesian \nrepresentation. Figure B.1 also suggests that a polar representation is useful and that the radius r and \nthe angle u could also characterize a complex number.\nHow do we connect the Cartesian and polar representations mathematically?

Their relation to Cartesian coordinates can be read from\nFig. 1.36:\nx = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\ny = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\nz = r cos \u03b8.\n(1.62)\nFigure 1.36 also shows three unit vectors, \u02c6\nr, \u02c6\n\u03b8, \u02c6\n\u03c6, pointing in the direction of\nincrease of the corresponding coordinates. They constitute an orthogonal (mutu-\nally perpendicular) basis set (just like \u02c6\nx, \u02c6\ny, \u02c6\nz), and any vector A can be expressed\nin terms of them, in the usual way:\nA = Ar \u02c6\nr + A\u03b8 \u02c6\n\u03b8 + A\u03c6 \u02c6\n\u03c6;\n(1.63)\nAr, A\u03b8, and A\u03c6 are the radial, polar, and azimuthal components of A.

We are now in a position to answer\n(qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material\nwhen it is placed in an electric \ufb01eld?

(Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the align-\nment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost\nat once when the \ufb01eld is removed.)\nNotice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little\ndipoles pointing along the direction of the \ufb01eld\u2014the material becomes polarized.\nA convenient measure of this effect is\nP \u2261dipole moment per unit volume,\nwhich is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about\nhow the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are\nnot as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules there will be\n3In asymmetric molecules, the induced dipole moment may not be parallel to the \ufb01eld, but if the\nmolecules are randomly oriented, the perpendicular contributions will average to zero. Within a single\ncrystal, the orientations are certainly not random, and we would have to treat this case separately.\n"

It\u2019s simpler to calculate the force\nassuming constant Q, because then you don\u2019t have to worry about work done by\nthe battery; but if you insist, it can be done correctly either way.\nNotice that we were able to determine the force without knowing anything\nabout the fringing \ufb01elds that are ultimately responsible for it! Of course, it\u2019s built\ninto the whole structure of electrostatics that \u2207\u00d7 E = 0, and hence that the fring-\ning \ufb01elds must be present; we\u2019re not really getting something for nothing here\u2014\njust cleverly exploiting the internal consistency of the theory. The energy stored\nin the fringing \ufb01elds themselves (which was not accounted for in this derivation)\nstays constant, as the slab moves; what does change is the energy well inside the\ncapacitor, where the \ufb01eld is nice and uniform.\nProblem 4.28 Two long coaxial cylindrical metal tubes (inner radius a, outer radius\nb) stand vertically in a tank of dielectric oil (susceptibility \u03c7e, mass density \u03c1)."

The\nanswer is that both in the production of a magnetic \ufb01eld (Biot-Savart) and in its\ndetection (Lorentz), it is the current that matters, and we can compensate for a\nsmallish velocity by pouring huge amounts of charge down the wire.

You\nmight ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is \u201cpure\u201d\ndipole\u2014for which Eq. 5.85 is exact? Well, yes and no: like the electrical analog,\nit can be done, but the model is a bit contrived. To begin with, you must take an\nin\ufb01nitesimally small loop at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole mo-\nment \ufb01nite, you have to crank the current up to in\ufb01nity, with the product m = Ia\nheld \ufb01xed. In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever\nthe distance r greatly exceeds the size of the loop.\nThe magnetic \ufb01eld of a (perfect) dipole is easiest to calculate if we put m at\nthe origin and let it point in the z-direction (Fig. 5.54)."

Ferromagnets\u2014which are emphatically not lin-\near11\u2014require no external \ufb01elds to sustain the magnetization; the alignment is\n\u201cfrozen in.\u201d Like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism involves the magnetic dipoles\nassociated with the spins of unpaired electrons. The new feature, which makes fer-\nromagnetism so different from paramagnetism, is the interaction between nearby\ndipoles: In a ferromagnet, each dipole \u201clikes\u201d to point in the same direction as its\nneighbors. The reason for this preference is essentially quantum mechanical, and\nI shall not endeavor to explain it here; it is enough to know that the correlation is\nso strong as to align virtually 100% of the unpaired electron spins. If you could\nsomehow magnify a piece of iron and \u201csee\u201d the individual dipoles as tiny arrows,\nit would look something like Fig. 6.25, with all the spins pointing the same way.\nBut if that is true, why isn\u2019t every wrench and nail a powerful magnet? The\nanswer is that the alignment occurs in relatively small patches, called domains.\nEach domain contains billions of dipoles, all lined up (these domains are actually\nvisible under a microscope, using suitable etching techniques\u2014see Fig. 6.26), but\nthe domains themselves are randomly oriented. The household wrench contains an\nenormous number of domains, and their magnetic \ufb01elds cancel, so the wrench as\na whole is not magnetized. (Actually, the orientation of domains is not completely\nrandom; within a given crystal, there may be some preferential alignment along\nthe crystal axes. But there will be just as many domains pointing one way as\nthe other, so there is still no large-scale magnetization. Moreover, the crystals\nthemselves are randomly oriented within any sizable chunk of metal.)\nHow, then, would you produce a permanent magnet, such as they sell in\ntoy stores? If you put a piece of iron into a strong magnetic \ufb01eld, the torque\nN = m \u00d7 B tends to align the dipoles parallel to the \ufb01eld. Since they like to stay\nparallel to their neighbors, most of the dipoles will resist this torque. However,\nFIGURE 6.25\n11In this sense, it is misleading to speak of the susceptibility or permeability of a ferromagnet. The\nterms are used for such materials, but they refer to the proportionality factor between a differential\nincrease in H and the resulting differential change in M (or B); moreover, they are not constants, but\nfunctions of H.\n"

It\u2019s not surprising,\nthough, that very high temperatures do destroy the alignment. What is surprising\nis that this occurs at a precise temperature (770\u25e6C, for iron)."

Off hand, you might expect a large current in the battery and\nnone at all in the lamp. Who\u2019s doing the pushing, in the rest of the circuit, and how\ndoes it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each\nsegment? What\u2019s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally)\nat a snail\u2019s pace (see Prob. 5.20), why doesn\u2019t it take half an hour for the current\nto reach the light bulb? How do all the charges know to start moving at the same\ninstant?\nAnswer: If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, dur-\ning the \ufb01rst split second after the switch is closed), then charge would be piling up\nsomewhere, and\u2014here\u2019s the crucial point\u2014the electric \ufb01eld of this accumulating\ncharge is in such a direction as to even out the \ufb02ow. Suppose, for instance, that\nthe current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge\npiles up at the \u201cknee,\u201d and this produces a \ufb01eld aiming away from the kink.3 This\n\ufb01eld opposes the current \ufb02owing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current\n\ufb02owing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is\nno further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It\u2019s a beautiful\nsystem, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it\nall so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all\naround the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies.\nFIGURE 7.7\nIin\nIout\nE\nE\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nFIGURE 7.8\n3The amount of charge involved is surprisingly small\u2014see W.

Most elementary particles are unstable: they\ndisintegrate after a characteristic lifetime6 that varies from one species to the next.\nThe lifetime of a neutron is 15 min; of a muon, 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 s; and of a neutral pion,\n9 \u00d7 10\u221217 s.

The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of\nthe ladder hits the far side of the barn, something has to give, and the farmer is left\neither with a broken ladder inside the barn or with the ladder intact poking through\na hole in the wall.

Like all sciences,\nthe basis of thermodynamics is experimental observation.  In thermodynamics\nthese findings have been formalized into certain basic laws, which are known as\nthe first, second, and third law of thermodynamics.  In addition to these laws,\nthe zeroth law of thermodynamics, which in the logical development of\nthermodynamics precedes the first law, has been set forth.\nIn what follows, we will present the basic thermodynamics laws, and apply\nthem to a number of representative examples.\nBefore, a brief description of a CANDU nuclear plant will be presented to\nillustrate the actual thermodynamics processes and the required equipment.\nCANDU 600 Primary (Heat Transport) Circuit:  380 reactor channels are\ndistributed in four groups of 95 pressure tubes.  Each group is connected to a\nsingle inlet and outlet header via individual feeders.  The core is cooled by heavy\nwater coolant circulating in two distinct circuits, each one including two main\ncoolant pumps and two steam generators (see Fig. 1.1)."

Through the feedwater pumps and control valves, the cold\nwater is then supplied to the preheater (lower part) of the steam generators\n(see Fig. 1.1)\n"

For example, when one of the weights on the piston in Fig. 2.3  is\nremoved, the piston rises and a change in state occurs, for the pressure decreases\nand the specific volume increases.  The path of the succession of states through\nwhich the system passes is called the process.\nWhen a system in a given initial state goes through a number of different\nchanges of state or processes and finally returns to its initial state, the system has\nundergone a Cycle.   Therefore, at the conclusion of a cycle, all the properties\nhave the same value they had at the beginning.

We usually neglect viscosity\nvariation with pressure in practical calculations.\nThe ratio of viscosity to density often appears in the equations describing fluid\nmotion.  This ratio is given the name kinematic viscosity and is usually denoted\nby the symbol \u03bd:\nAn effect usually associated with fluid viscosity is the no-slip condition.\nWhenever a fluid is in contact with a solid surface, the velocity of the fluid at the\nsurface is equal to the velocity of the surface (Fig. 2.2)."

If a conduit has a circular cross\nsection of constant area, it is called a pipe.  Constant-area conduits with other\ncross sections (the most common being rectangular and annular) are called\nducts.  Fluid transport systems composed of pipes or ducts have many practical\napplications.  Power plants contain many pipes and ducts for transporting fluids\ninvolved in the energy-conversion process.\nWe will consider fully developed flow.  The flow in a constant-area pipe or duct\nis said to be fully developed if the velocity profile is the same at all cross\nsections.  Fully developed flow is relatively simple to analyse because it is one\ndimensional.  Many pipe flows are fully developed.\n2\nHydraulic Resistance of Networks\nIn each flow system, as well as in its separate segments, the portion of the total\npressure which is spent in overcoming the forces of hydraulic resistance is\nirreversibly lost.  The molecular and turbulent viscosity of the moving medium\nirreversibly converts the mechanical work of the resistance forces into heat.\nTherefore, the total energy (thermal energy inclusive) of the flow over the given\nsegment of the pipe remains constant in the absence of heat conduction through\nthe walls.  However, the state of the flow undergoes a change because of the\npressure drop.  The temperature, on the other hand, does not change at constant\nvelocity.  This can be attributed to the fact that the work of expansion due to a\npressure drop is entirely converted into the work of overcoming the resistance\nforces and the heat generated by this mechanical work compensates for the\nexpansion-induced cooling.\nAt the same time, the energy acquired by the flow resulting from the work of a\ncompressor, fan, etc., in the form of kinetic or thermal energy, is lost for the given\nsystem during the fluid\u2019s discharge into the atmosphere or into another\nreservoir.\nTwo types of the total pressure (hydraulic resistance) losses in the pipeline are\nconsidered:\n- \nPressure losses resulting from friction (frictional drag), \u2206pfr\n- \nLocal pressure losses (local resistance), \u2206ploc, see Figure 2.1.\n"

Screw,\nreciprocating, diaphragm and liquid ring seal types of p.d. pumps and\ncompressors are used in the plant.\nThe reasons for using a centrifugal pump are:\nIts operation is smooth, whereas the operation of a positive displacement\npump is often pulsating.\nIts shutoff head is limited, whereas the shutoff head of a p.d. pump is\ntheoretically infinite.  This makes a safety relief valve, on the discharge side\nof a p.d. machine mandatory.\nIts capacity can be varied by throttling, if necessary, whereas, the capacity of\na p.d. pump is practically constant, throttled or unthrottled.  However, not\nmany centrifugal pumps in a CANDU plant are operated by a flow control\nvalve, or by any kind of throttling.  All valves in most of the process lines\nremain fully open.  That means, flow remains fairly constant for most\nsystems.\nCentrifugal pumps are cheaper and more readily available.\nProcess conditions like head, flow rate, and viscosity of fluid in the vast\nmajority of process systems in a CANDU plant are more suitable for\ncentrifugal pumps.\nA p.d. pump is considered for a system only when the capacity is too low in\nrespect of its head, and a suitable centrifugal pump is not available.  Also, when\nthe liquid handled is too viscous, a p.d. pump is the only choice.\nVertical or horizontal orientation of any pump is selected according to the\nconfiguration of piping system and space available.  Horizontal pumps are\nalways given the first preference if adequate space is available, as they are\ncheaper than the vertical pumps and easier to maintain. Horizontal pumps have\nfewer rotor dynamics problems in comparison with the vertical ones.\nThe largest, and probably the most important pump in a CANDU plant, namely\nthe Heat Transport pump, is vertical.  The choice was entirely dependent on the\navailability of space, suitable location in the piping arrangement, and the ease of\nshielding the pump inside containment while keeping the motor outside for\nsome stations.\n5.2 \nFeatures of CANDU Pumps\nThere are, however, some special features that make most of the pumps in a\nCANDU plant slightly different.\n"

The manufacturing process and the\nquality assurance process thus are quite stringent.  Every step in manufacturing\nis rigorously inspected and recorded.  This makes the pumps highly reliable and,\nof course, costly.\nSecondly, most of the CANDU pumps handle heavy water which is costly.\nTherefore, the pumps are designed to be leak-proof.\nThere is another important reason for the pumps to be leak proof.  D2O gets\nirradiated in the nuclear process, causing the formation of radioactive tritiated\nwater, the concentration of which is to be kept limited in the containment for the\nsafety of the operating personnel.\nMechanical seals are used on most pumps rather than shaft packing. Mechanical\nseals are not absolutely leak proof, even when they look dry from outside.\nLiquid leaks into the atmosphere through seal faces in the form of vapour or\ndroplets.  A seamless variety of pump, called canned motor pump, is a zero\nleakage pump.  This is extensively used in a CANDU plant for application where\nthe pump is small.  Large capacity canned motor pumps are not available.  The\nbearings of canned motor pumps are made of carbon, and are flushed by the\noperating liquid.  The liquid must be absolutely clean and grit-free.  Excessive\nwear and tear of these bearings have been reported in several cases.  The\ndesigner is aware of the susceptibility of the design to these types of problems\nand takes appropriate measures.\nMechanical seals, where used, are of excellent quality, so that the loss of D2O and\nthe leakage of tritium thereby, are reduced to a minimum.\nThe Heat Transport pumps operate at high temperature and pressure, where\nsealing of the pump shaft is a real challenge.  The seals of these pumps are of\nspecial design.  They have been developed by AECL in collaboration with the\nmanufacturer of the pumps.\nMaterials of construction for equipment in a nuclear plant are selected carefully.\nSome materials, e.g. teflon, loose their mechanical properties when they are\nirradiated for a long time.  These materials are avoided if possible. Some other\nmaterials, e.g. Cobalt-60, convert themselves into a further source of radiation\nwhen they are irradiated.  These materials are also avoided if possible.  CANDU\nplants are built for a life of 30 years.  Selection of suitable materials of\nconstruction and providing adequate factor of safety is therefore important.\nCertain pumps in some CANDU stations have a dual capacity.  This is\naccomplished by operating the same pump at two different speeds.  For instance,\nthe Main Moderator system needs D2O circulation during the shutdown period\nor after a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) to remove the decay heat.  In\n600 MW stations, the moderator pump is operated at one-fourth of its normal\n"

The moderator pump\nthus can operate at one-fourth of its original flow during shutdown.\nThe benefit of operating the Heat Transport pumps at a reduced speed of\none-third of normal speed, after a LOCA, has recently been assessed.  Bruce B\nheat transport pumps are being modified for operating also at one-third of\nnormal speed.  The reduced speed will be achieved, in this case, by the solid\nstate control of a silicon control rectifier.  The reduced speed operation is under\nconsideration for the HT pumps in other CANDU stations.\nAnother special feature of some CANDU pumps is a minimum rotational\nrequirement.  Normally, a pump comes to a dead stop within a few seconds of a\npower cutoff.  That means, flow is practically zero within a few seconds of a\npower cutoff.  If there is a power failure, the heat transport pumps require\ncontinuous operation for some time to continue adequate fuel cooling.  A\nflywheel of high inertia is attached to the motor shaft which helps sustain D2O\nflow for a certain length of time.  The minimum rotational inertia, where\nrequired, is a function of the safety criteria to be met.  The physical means of\nprovision of the inertia in the rotating assembly is decided by the supplier in\nconjunction with the equipment designer.\nThere are quite a few large pumps in a CANDU plant, as illustrated in Table 5.1.\nAll other pumps are less than 100 HP."

The pump characteristic curve shows the relation between the head\ndeveloped by the pump and its rate of discharge when the pump is operating at\na given rotative speed.\nThe system characteristic curve shows the relation between the required\npumping head and the flow rate in the pipeline.\nThe actual pump-operating head and flow rate are determined by the\nintersection of the two curves.  The usual mode of operation of a pump is at\nconstant speed.  The efficiency of the pump drops off as the rotative speed is\nmoved away from the optimum speed.  It is possible to vary the pump\ncharacteristics with different impeller and casing designs.  Thus a flat\ncharacteristic permits a considerable variation in the rate of discharge with but\nlittle change in head, while a steep characteristic gives only a small variation in\nthe flow for a relatively large change in head.\nFigures 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 illustrate the performance curves for Gentilly-2 and\nWolsong 2 HT pumps and a D2O pump, respectively.\n"

The\nphenomena occur regularly in boiling-water reactors, and in pressurized-water\nreactors at high power densities.  In general, two-phase flow implies the\nconcurrent flow of two phases, such as liquid and its vapor (one component),\nliquid and gas (two components), gas and solid, etc.  This chapter deals mainly\nwith the first type, liquid and vapor flow.  Flow in reactor channels, past\nrestrictions, and critical flow will be discussed.\nThe accurate prediction of two-phase pressure drop in the coolant conduits of\nCANDU reactors is important because the channel pressure drop is intimately\nrelated to the coolant flow and enthalpy distribution.  The total pressure drop,\nduring the flow of a two-phase mixture consisting of a liquid and vapor, is the\nsum of the hydrostatic head, acceleration pressure drop (momentum flux\ncontribution) and the frictional pressure losses.  Evaluation of two-phase\npressure drop requires adoption of a void fraction correlation to calculate the\nhydrostatic and acceleration components of two-phase pressure drop and a two-\nphase friction multiplier correlation to calculate frictional pressure drop.  Over\nthe past forty years, a great deal of effort has been expended in an attempt to\nunderstand the mechanisms contributing to the frictional pressure losses in two-\nphase flow.  Although a number of correlations, both theoretical and empirical\nhave been proposed, none are general enough to provide an accurate calculation\nof two-phase frictional pressure drop over a wide range of pressures, flow rates,\ngeometries and fluids.  \n2."

Three areas\nhave been identified: critical flow, pumps and natural circulation. \nCritical flows occur when the velocity of the two phase mixture is controlled by\nits upper limit, i.e. the sonic velocity of the mixture.  That velocity is a very\nstrong function of quality, since it can vary from 300 m/s to 1400 m/s from\nsingle phase steam to single phase liquid for water.\nThe pumps are normally operated under single-phase conditions.  Under\ndegraded conditions two-phase mixture at the inlet of the pump can create\nsevere vibrations that could either deteriorate the pump hydraulics or break a\npipe.\nThermosyphoning is a mode of cooling that is relied upon, under no forced flow\nconditions.  In many scenarios the pressure and inventory control of the HT\ncannot preclude the formation of void and the HT is operating under two-phase\nflow conditions.\n2."

The device used to implement this exchange is termed a heat\nexchanger, and specific applications may be found in space heating and air-\nconditioning, power production, waste heat recovery, and chemical processing.\nIn this lesson we consider the principles of heat transfer needed to design\nand/or to evaluate the performance of a heat exchanger.\n2\nHeat Exchanger Types\nHeat exchangers are typically classified according to flow arrangement and type of\nconstruction. The simplest heat exchanger is one for which the hot and cold\nfluids move in the same or opposite directions in a concentric tube (or double-pipe)\nconstruction.  In the parallel-flow arrangement of Figure 2.1a, the hot and cold\nfluids enter at the same end, flow in the same direction, and leave at the same\nend.  In the counterflow arrangement of Figure 2.1b, the fluids enter at opposite\nends, flow in opposite directions, and leave at opposite ends.\nFig. 2.1: \nConcentric Tube Heat Exchangers.\n(a) Parallel flow.  (b) Counterflow.\nAlternatively, the fluids may move in cross flow (perpendicular to each other), as\nshown by the finned and unfinned tubular heat exchangers of Figure 2.2. The two\nconfigurations differ according to whether the fluid moving over the tubes is\nunmixed or mixed.  In Figure 2.2a, the fluid is said to be unmixed\nbecause the fins prevent motion in a direction (y) that is transverse to the main-\nflow direction (x)."

In\ncontrast, for the unfinned tube bundle of Figure 2.2b, fluid motion, hence\nmixing, in the transverse direction is possible, and temperature variations are\nprimarily in the main-flow direction.  Since the tube flow is unmixed, both fluids\nare unmixed in the finned exchanger, while one fluid is mixed and the other\nunmixed in the unfinned exchanger.  The nature of the mixing condition can\nsignificantly influence heat exchanger performance.\n"

Also, for  gas-to-gas heat exchanger,\nuse is often made of regenerators in which the same space is alternately occupied\nby the hot and cold gases.  In a fixed regenerator such as a packed bed, the hot\nand cold gases alternately enter a stationary, porous solid.  In a rotary\nregenerator, the porous solid is a rotating well, which alternately exposes its\nsurfaces to the continuously flowing hot and cold gases.

Another important aspect is that the right choices have\nto be made in order to minimize costs and delays and eventually further\nresearch effort and expense.\nThe requirements of materials\u2019 properties in nuclear reactors can be divided in\ntwo main categories:  the general properties and the special properties.  The\ngeneral properties are very similar to the conventional engineering properties of\nmaterials required in most engineering designs.  The general properties are listed\nin Table 1.1 and are explained in greater detail in section 2.\nTable 1.1: \nGeneral Properties of Nuclear Reactor Materials\nMechanical strength\nDuctility\nStructural integrity\nFabricability, machinability\nCorrosion resistance\nHeat transfer properties\nThermal stability\nCompatibility\nAvailability\nCosts\nThe structural materials which are not exposed to radiation or to the primary\ncoolant system fall into this category.\nThe special properties arise from nuclear radiation, as material can suffer change\nunder severe radiation exposure.  The effect of radiation on nuclear reactor\nmaterials are treated in section 3.\nMaterial requirements can vary widely depending on the particular design.  In\nall cases, fuel materials, cladding, moderator and structural material must be\nselected to meet the appropriate requirements.

The degree of corrosion resistance depends mainly on the service\nconditions.  This aspect is treated in greater detail in Chemical Aspects of\nNuclear Power Plant Operations.\n2.3\nHeat transfer properties, thermal stability, \nand materials compatibility\nHeat transfer considerations have been reviewed in earlier modules.  However,\nthermal conductivity should usually be high and the coefficient of thermal\nexpansion low or well matched with that of other adjacent material.\nThermal stability is an important property for materials that usually operate at\nelevated temperature.  In most practical cases, the mechanical strength,\nstructural integrity and corrosion resistance of the structure and piping materials\ndecrease with increasing temperature.  Particularly, thermal conductivities of\nuranium and plutonium oxides decrease severely near their melting point\ntemperatures.  Thus, high thermal stability is essential for the safe operation of\nnuclear reactors.\nMaterial compatibility is a major criterion that requires all elements and all\ncomponents in a given system to be compatible.  In other words, the materials\nselected for each element or component of the system must function properly\nand consistently.  In a light water reactor, for instance, the material of a pressure\nvessel must be compatible with the coolant.  The cladding material must be\ncompatible with both the coolant and the fuel.  The corrosion resistance of the\nvessel or cladding material must be sufficiently high, so that the structural\nmaterial and the coolant are compatible and function properly while the reactor\nis operating.\n3.0\nRadiations Effects on Materials\n3.1\nFundamental effects\nThe unique characteristic of the reactor environment is the presence of intense\nradiation.  The radiations in a nuclear reactor consist of alpha and beta particles,\ngamma rays, neutrons, fissions fragments, and possibly protons.  Although\nfission fragments are not strictly nuclear radiations, their behaviour is generally\nsimilar to that of alpha particles and protons.  There are, however, differences in\ndegree arising from much greater mass of fission fragments.  In addition, the\ngaseous fission products, e.g., krypton and xenon, introduce many problems of a\ndifferent kind in connection with solid fuel materials.  An important effect on\nfuel exposed to high burnup is the swelling due to volume enlargement caused\nby the accumulation of gaseous fission products within the fuel structure. \n"

Ionization and electronic excitation, for example,\nproduced by beta particles and gamma rays cause very little permanent change\nin metals.  The reason is that in a metal the electrons in the conduction band are\nable to accept very small amounts of excitation energy, and so a considerable\nproportion of the energy of the radiation is absorbed in causing electronic\nexcitation.

Irradiation hardening can result in an increase of\nyield and ultimate strength (or stress), but a decrease of ductility.  Irradiation\nembrittlement produced by impurity atoms (He4, H, N, etc.) of nuclear\ntransmutation, radiation decomposition, and other effects can cause a fracture\nfailure of reactor primary components.

The calandria vault contains the\ncalandria vessel.  Figure 5.4 is an exploded view of the calandria.  This is a large\ncylindrical tank containing the perforated end shields.  The end shields are\njoined together by lattice tubes and are cooled by a light water circuit separate\nfrom the moderator circuit.  The vessel is made of an ASME grade 304L\naustenitic stainless steel plate.  Use of this grade of stainless steel with\ncompatible welding processes and the lower temperature of operation has\navoided the problems that have faced BWR piping with cracking in 304 piping\nwelds.\n"

Many operating problems and costly repairs to\nreactor components around the world can be and have been blamed on\ninadequate chemistry control.\nThere are five primary objectives of chemistry control.  These may not all apply\nin a particular system, but when more than one have to be considered, the\nrequirements may conflict.  The best chemistry control may therefore be a\ncompromise.  The objectives of chemistry control are to:\na)\nminimize corrosion to maintain system integrity, to preserve worker and\npublic safety, and to minimize costs;\nb) minimize activity transport to provide a healthy work environment and to\nminimize costs;\nc)\ncontrol reactivity to obtain maximum reactor efficiency and to preserve\nworker and public safety;\nd) minimize radiolysis to maintain system integrity and to preserve worker and\npublic safety; and\ne)\nminimize surface fouling to minimize heat transfer inefficiencies and costs\nand to preserve system integrity.\nIt is important to realize that to have its maximum effect, chemistry control must\nbe considered from the concept stage of the plant through to the end of plant life\nand decommissioning.\nThe diversity of the materials in any one system and their different reactions to\nthe environment clearly necessitate careful control of chemistry for optimum\nperformance.\nA review of chemistry basics is given at the beginning of this lesson.  The\nchemical control of the various process systems, namely, the heat transport\nsystem, the moderator system, the feedwater/condensate system and the\nrecirculating water system, of a typical CANDU reactor are treated in details.\n"

The radiolytes (radiolytic fragments) invariably form new\ncompounds.  Radiolysis reaction of deuterium follows the equation:\n2D2O\u21922D2 + O2\nThis produces both deuterium and oxygen molecules.  Radiolysis of D2O is\nincreased by many impurities.\nThere are concerns relating to radiolysis in the CANDU system which are:\n\u2022\nDeuterium and oxygen present an explosion hazard when they migrate to\nthe helium cover gas of the moderator.  Passing the cover gas through the\nrecombination units to recombine the D2 and O2 into D2O is required to\nalleviate this problem.\n\u2022\nO2 formed by radiolysis in the heat transport system (HTS) presents a serious\ncorrosion problem for carbon steel and its protective magnetite layer.  O2 is\nscavenged from the HTS by adding H2 to react with it, producing H2O.  The\nhigh operating pressure (\u22489 MPa) keeps most of the D2 and other gases in\nsolution; therefore, D2 does not present an explosion hazard in the HTS.\n2.4\nRecombination units\nAs previously mentioned, moderator radiolysis can produce explosive mixture\nof deuterium (D2) and oxygen (O2) in the helium cover gas system.  During\nnormal plant operation, the recombination units are capable of maintaining  safe\nlevels of D2 and O2 in the cover gas by promoting the reforming of heavy water\nfrom its gaseous component.\nThe following chemical equation depicts the recombination reaction of D2 and\nO2:\n2D2 + O2 \u21922D2O\nThe palladium catalyst in the recombination units makes the reaction possible at\nlow concentrations.  Therefore:\n\u2022\nThe D2 and O2 recombine at a lower temperature and below the lower\nexplosive concentration.\n\u2022\nLow concentrations produce less heat because the amount of heat given off is\nproportional to the quantity of gases recombining.\n\u2022\nThe reaction is described as proceeding quietly, i.e., without an explosion or\ncombustion.\nWithout a catalyst, recombination will only occur by combustion.  If radiolysis\nproceeds more rapidly than recombination, the levels of D2 and O2 in the cover\ngas will increase.  Deuterium in excess of 8% by volume in the helium is\npotentially explosive, and therefore running a unit at greater than 4% in D2 is not\npermitted.\nThe flame arresters on the inlet and outlet of the units are added protection\n"

Consequently, the desired operating condition to minimize\nconductivity, and therefore radiolysis, would be close to pH 7.  A neutral pH is\nalso desirable to minimize corrosion of moderator system components such as\npumps and heat exchangers.\nModerator pH is controlled only in conjunction with conductivity using ion\nexchange columns to remove impurity ions, and replace them with OD- and D+\nions, i.e., D2O.  If the conductivity of the moderator is held very low it consists of\nessentially pure D2O which ionizes very slightly.  Therefore, because of the lack\nof ions, the pH meter will read erratically although the moderator is essentially\nneutral, i.e., no OD- or D+ ions present.  Thus when the moderator conductivity\nis very low, the pH meter is unusable but the pH is accepted as 7.

While more alkaline conditions would be better for\nboth the iron and the magnetite on the ferrous piping, the higher alkalinity\nwould be harmful to the copper alloy condenser and feedheater tubes.\nMaintaining the above desired condensate pH keeps the boiler water pH at the\ndesired value of 9.1.\nThe use of ammonia is undesirable because it promotes the oxidation of copper\nand zinc when oxygen is present.\nAll-Ferrous Systems\nThe desired condensate pH is 9.8.  The pH is maintained at station with all-\nferrous feed trains by the addition of ammonia.  The use of morpholine has been\ndemonstrated to result in reduced corrosion product transport in the feedwater,\nand reduced erosion/corrosion in two phase (wet steam) regions.  For this\nreason morpholine use is also specified at the stations with all-ferrous feed\ntrains.  It is not intended that morpholine will be used to maintain the pH,\nalthough it will certainly contribute.  Both additives are volatile and thus impart\nalkalinity to the condensate.  Maintaining the above desired condensate pH\nkeeps the boiler water pH at the desired value of 9.6.\nFigure 5.9:  \nSteam generator pH limits during normal operations\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n20\n24 Hour \r\nshutdown limit\nImmediate shutdown followed by\r\n cooldown to less than 100\u00b0C \n100 Hour shutdown limit\nNormal operation limit\n100 Hour shutdown limit\nImmediate shutdown followed by\r\nimmediate cooldown to less than 100\u00b0C \n24 Hour \r\nshutdown limit\n40\n60\nTime (hours)\nSteam Generator pH\n80\n100\n120\n"

            "Sentence": "Chemical Aspects - Page 37\nTraining Centre / Centre de formation\n5.4.2\nBoiler Water Cation Conductivity\nBoiler water has a high background conductivity (K\u00b0) because of pH additives\n(morpholine, ammonia) and traces of water salts and dissolved corrosion\nproducts.  Hence, ordinary (specific) conductivity is not sensitive enough to be\nused as a control parameter.  Therefore a sample of boiler water is passed\nthrough a cation exchange column, which replaces all cations (including those of\nmorpholine, ammonia and hydrazine) with the much more conductive H+ ion.\nAlso, the conductive hydroxides formed by the morpholine or ammonia have\nbeen replaced by non-conductive water.  This heightens the sensitivity for the\npresence of anions (normally Cl - and/or SO4\n- -, because HCl and H2SO4 are more\nconductive than any other salts.  The conductivity of a sample thus treated is\ncalled cation conductivity.  The desired cation conductivity specification for\nboiler water is less than 0.3 mS/m.\nThe use of very low conductivity makeup water from the WTP is a major factor\nin maintaining a low conductivity of the boiler water.  Continuous blowdown\ncontrols the boiler water conductivity by constantly removing impurities from\nthe system.  Cation conductivity of the boiler water is monitored by continuous\nanalysis, with grab sample verification, and is a shutdown control parameter.\nMaintaining cation conductivity within the specification limits protects against\nboiler tube corrosion.\n5.4.3\nDissolved Oxygen\nBecause oxygen is a strong oxidizer, dissolved O2 is the most harmful impurity\nin system.  The desired concentration of dissolved O2 are less or equal to 10\n\u00b5g/kg for the condensate and less or equal to 5 \u00b5g/kg for the feedwater.\nDissolved oxygen control is achieved in three stages following the condenser air\nextraction system.  Since the main source of oxygen is from air leaking into sub-\natmospheric parts of the turbine/condenser/extraction steam lines, a program to\nlocate and seal air in-leakage is a major control factor.\nDissolved oxygen is removed from the condensate by the deaerator which\ncontains sprays and cascade trays over which the hot water tumbles.  The\ncombination of heat and large surface area imparted to the water provides very\nefficient stripping of dissolved gases.  Oxygen is reduced to less than 10 \u00b5g/kg\nand nitrogen is also removed.  This efficient stripping action reduces the\nconsumption of hydrazine.\nThe final stage of dissolved oxygen removal is by the injection of hydrazine,\n(N2H4), between the deaerator and the deaerator storage tank, to chemically\nreact with the remaining oxygen.  It is injected at this point to:\n\u2022\nprovide adequate temperature for reaction,\n\u2022\nprovide hold up time in the deaerator storage tank and\n\u2022\nensure it will not be removed by the deaerator.\n"
